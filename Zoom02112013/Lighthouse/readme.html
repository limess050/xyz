        <p>
            Released August 24, 2007
        </p>
        <b>Summary:
            <br>
            <br>
        </b>
        This ended up being a bigger release than planned (it was
        originally called 2.4.1).� Originally just intended to be a maintenance
        release, one thing led to another and the user interface for the site
        editor has been almost completely redesigned.� The new design is easier
        on the eyes, and provides a lot more timely information to the user, 
        and hopefully improves the general user experience.� 
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition to the visible changes, a lot has changed under the
        covers.� The benefits of most of the architecture changes won't be
        fully realized until a later release, but the benefits are going to be
        significant.
        <br>
        <br>
        Changes to look for now are:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Page topic tagging: similar to tagging in other high-profile
                applications (Flickr, Gmail), allows pages to be tagged with
                topics, which then informs the search results and can be used in
                custom code throughout the site.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the user attempts to leave a page without saving his or her
                changes, they will be warned and given a chance to save.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a user's session expires while editing, their changes will
                be preserved and submitted after they log in again.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ability to edit the Description meta tag on a page by page
                basis.
                <br>
            </li>
        </ul>

                The way that the Request.AppVirtualPath variable was set did

                When specifying a relative url (e.g. index.cfm) for a link,
                this could result in an incorrect url because the file is assumed

                is automatically added to relative urls so that the file is assumed
                to be relative to the server root.

                Unicode support. This allows us to support content that uses
                non-latin characters (Chinese and Russian, for instance). In order
                for this to work, the datasource needs to have the option checked

                before interacting with it if it is included in the page in the

                I added the ability for the display options be temporary. The
                display options page now has a checkbox to remember the display
                setting, which is checked by default so that it still works the way
                it has always worked unless you uncheck the box. If the box is
                unchecked, the display options are carried in the url, and they
                remain until the user browses away from the current admin page.
                Once you are in this "temporary view" mode, changes made to the
                columns displayed, column order, or number of rows displayed, will
                only be temporary and will not be saved in the user's profile,
                unless they go to the Display Options page and check the
                "Remember..." box.

                Unicode support. This allows us to support content that uses
                non-latin characters (Chinese and Russian, for instance). There is
                a new MS_TableColumn parameter called "unicode". In order to use
                unicode, set that parameter to "true", use an nvarchar field in the
                database, and set the ColdFusion datasource to "Enable Unicode for
                data sources configured for non-Latin characters".
            </li>
            <li>
                Added support for the file, select-popup, and checkbox column

            </li>
            <li>
                New parameter for MS_TableChild called "editbydefault". If set
                to "No", child records will be displayed in read-only mode and the
                user will need to click a button to edit the record.
            </li>
            <li>
                New parameter for MS_TableChild called "ordercolumn". The int
                column used to order the child table. If this is supplied, the user
                will have the ability to re-order the child records. To set the
                order without allowing the user to reorder the records, use the
                orderby parameter.
            </li>
            <li>
                New parameter for MS_TableColumn called "autoselect". If "Yes",
                the select popup will automatically come up when a record is added.
                Currently only implemented if the column is within a child
                table.
            </li>
            <li>
                New parameter for MS_Table called "groupby". This parameter is
                used to specify the group by clause of the select statement on the
                view page. This is most useful for generating reports. When the
                group by clause is specified, the only columns that can be
                displayed are columns in the group by clause, and pseudo columns
                that use aggregate functions. Trying to display any other columns
                will result in an SQL error, so they should be marked as
                AllowView="No".
            </li>
            <li>
                New parameter for MS_TableColumn called "allowview". If set to
                "No", there will be no option to view the column on the view page.
                This is different from "Hidden" in that is it still searchable and
                editable. This parameter was created along with the GroupBy
                paramter of MS_Table. If you are grouping on a list of columns, you
                may want to search on a column (say, a date range), but don't want
                to include the column in the group by.
            </li>
            <li>
                Changed the MS_TableColumn searchtype parameter. Changed
                default from "Equals" to "Contains". If type is "textarea",
                "Equals" is not allowed and if "Equals" is specified it will
                automatically change to "Contains".

                There were problems if a field is marked as Required and Hidden
                at the same time. Added a mechanism to show warnings about syntax
                errors. In this case, if a column is required and hidden, a default
                value must be specified.

        <h4>New Features:</h4>
        <p>
            Installation:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Admin pages now use custom tags with prefixes instead of the
                cfmodule. This makes the code cleaner and improves performance. For
                example, to call the MS_Table tag, use cfimport tag at the top of
                the template (e.g. &lt;cfimport prefix="lh"
                taglib="../Lighthouse/Tags"&gt;) and call the tag as
                &lt;lh:MS_Table ...&gt;.
            </li>
            <li>
                Changed name of ModernCF2 directory to "Lighthouse". The
                Lighthouse directory is now assumed to be a subdirectory from the
                web root. It was previously possible to have more than one site
                accessing the same ModernCF2 directory, but since that feature
                wasn't really used, and required setting several additional
                variables in the Application.cfm file, it seemed to make sense to
                go for simplicity over flexibility in this case.
            </li>
            <li>
                Changed Application.cfm to use Request scope variables and
                trimmed down the number of variables needed. This could require
                some changes to current code when updating, but in most cases it
                should be possible to do global search and replace operations to
                make the changes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added the parameter Request.lh_authType that can be "basic" or
                "auto". It is used authenticate password-protected RSS feeds (see
                below). Basic authentication is preferable, but requires that all
                authentication (basic and nt) be turned off in IIS, which may not
                be possible in shared environments.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added the ability to easily password protect development sites.
                When setting development paramters in Application.cfm, include the
                Lighthouse/Admin/checkQaLogin.cfm file. This will password protect
                the entire site with a popup window. The user can enter the same
                username and password given to them to view the admin. This
                requires that Request.lh_authType be set to "basic".
            </li>
            <li>
                To use user-friendly urls (see below), set up custom 404 error
                to point to /404.cfm.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Site Editor
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The properties button now generates a popup just like all the
                other toolbar buttons. This makes it more consistent, and also, I
                think, makes it intuitive to have to push the page live for the
                changes to take effect.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added "Restore Deleted Pages" function under Site menu in
                admin. When a page is deleted, the working version is deleted and
                the live version is archived. The "Restore Deleted Pages" function
                allows any archived version of a deleted page to be restored. Also,
                if the user goes to a page in the site editor that has been
                deleted, they will will be alerted to the fact that the page has
                been deleted and given the chance to view the archives, if
                available.
            </li>
            <li>
                Allow the use of search engine- and user-friendly urls. In
                order to enable this the variable Request.lh_useFriendlyUrls in
                Application.cfm must be set to true, and the file /404.cfm must be
                set to handle 404 errors for the server. (HostMySite allows us to
                specify the 404 handler in their control panel, so this should be
                easy to do for most, if not all, of our clients.) If this is
                enabled, then the name of the page can be appended to the site url
                to go to the page. The New Page and Page Properties dialogs have
                been enhanced to automatically strip out unwanted characters and to
                show the resulting url. If the name of page changes, the archive
                table will be searched to find the current page that corresponds to
                the old page name.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added a new page called "Search Engine Awareness" under Site
                menu in admin that gives easy access to tools to submit the site to
                search engines, and to manage the robots.txt file. Note that
                robots.txt file on devel is read only because it's in Vault, so it
                produces an error to try to change it on devel. Should work on the
                live server, though.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added a new field for "browser title" on the page properties
                screen that we can use to put more descriptive
                search-engine-friendly titles. If no browser title is specified,
                the site and page title will be used. Previously the nav title was
                used here, but now it only uses the nav title if no page title is
                available.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added a favicon.ico file to the distribution. This file is used
                by the browser to give a custom icon for the site in the address
                bar and bookmarks. It would be nice for the designer to create a
                favicon.ico for every site, but it's probably not necessary.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Database
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                When a record with a file column type is deleted, there is now
                an option to delete the file from the file system. There is a new
                parameter for image columns called "DeleteWithRecord". The
                parameter merely determines if the file is selected to be deleted
                by default or not. The user can always to choose whether to delete
                the file or not.
            </li>
            <li>
                As alternative to exporting search results to Excel, added
                ability to generate a CSV file that can then be downloaded.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added the ability to download an RSS feed for any search
                results. Added RssTitle, RssDescription, and RssPubDate parameters
                for the MS_Table tag. RSS is already pretty popular, but will
                probably become completely ubiquitous when the next version of IE
                comes out, which integrates an RSS reader.
                <br>
                The RSS feed can also be used to add a Live Bookmark in Firefox.
                http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/livebookmarks.html
                <br>
                Also added a template in Site Editor called "Index Page with RSS
                Feed". This provides a link to an RSS feed that includes all of the
                child pages for the page.
                <br>
                There are two types of authentication that can be used to access
                password-protected RSS feeds through most readers. The first and
                preferable one is basic authentication. This produces a u/p popup
                so that the user can enter their site login. In order for CF to do
                basic authentication, though, all IIS authentication has to be
                turned off, so this may not be available. I set up an alternative
                method of authentication that passes a code in the url of the RSS
                feed, so that the user should be able to log into the site in their
                browser, and then the RSS reader will automatically be given access
                based on the code in the url. In addition to the code being
                verified, the RSS reader must come from the same IP address as the
                browser used to login to the site. This is to prevent people from
                passing around a url that could potentially give anybody access to
                sensitive information. I'm not really sure how well this type of
                authentication is going to work in practice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added a new MS_TableChild tag to specify a table that has a
                many-to-one relationship with the main table. E.g. An OderLines
                table would be a child to an Orders table. You can use this in
                place of an MS_TableColumn tag and use the MS_TableColumn tag to
                identify columns of the child table. There are some limitations to
                the types of columns that can be placed within the child table. No
                multiple-value columns will work -- so that rules out
                select-multiple, checkboxgroup, etc. The functionality is limited
                in general, as the main goal of this release was to enable some
                specific features of our intranet (comments for issues, for
                example).
            </li>

        <hr><h3>Version 2.2.0</h3>
        <p>
            This is a significant release, including wysiwyg support for
            Firefox. The name of the product has now officially changed from
            ModernCF to Lighthouse!

            <li>
                The db folder now contains more helpfully names files. In the
                Upgrade folder are sql files that aim to be all you need to upgrade
                the database from one version to another. These files should be
                used with extreme caution, however, as they have been tested
                little, if at all.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Firefox support. One major difference in Firefox is that
                hitting Enter inserts a line break rather than a paragraph break.
                This is recognized as a bug by mozilla
                (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92686), but it is
                unclear when or if this will be fixed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Improved and standardized all properties popup windows. All now
                have "OK", "Cancel", and "Apply" options, and gave access to styles
                for all elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added style.xml file in the same folder as style.css for saving
                user-friendly names for styles that will be used in the wysiwyg.
                This was formally done with the editor-description property within
                the css file, but because that is not valid css, it didn't work in
                Firefox.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Site Editor 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Firefox support.
            </li>
            <li>
                Browse button now goes directly to page rather than showing a
                popup to choose the user. In most cases the popup is just a
                nuisance. If user impersonation is needed, we can build a separate
                screen to accomplish that.
            </li>
            <li>
                Standardized most dialog windows with same format as wysiwyg
                popups.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added template and permissions options to New Page dialog.
            </li>
            <li>
                Included a default robots.txt file.
            </li>
            <li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Added Options menu in admin with "Save Page" link, and removed
                Save Current Page from the bottom from all menus. The Options menu
                will be used in the future for other miscellaneous page
                functions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added ShowDate parameter for columns of type Date. Setting this
                parameter to false and setting ShowTime to true creates a column
                that just shows the time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added SiteEditor parameter for columns of type TextArea. If
                true, then Site Editor-related options will be available in the
                wysiwyg.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added a drop-down in page nav on view page to select the number
                of results to display per page. In the past, once you select View
                All you can't go back to restricting the number of results without
                going to the Display Options page.

                Hid old font drop-downs and added an icon (looks like an
                eyeball) that shows a styles drop-down with checkboxes so that
                multiple classes can be applied to a tag. All classes defined for
                the edit area are automatically available, as long as a special
                stylesheet property called "editor-description" is added to the
                stylesheet. This allows us to show just the classes that make sense
                and to display a user-friendly name for the class. Added a
                style_wysiwyg.css file in the application root to hold wysiwyg

                Added general file support to file browser, so that non-image
                files have appropriate icons displayed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Link dialog now has "Choose a File" option that links to file

            <li>
                Changes to enhance the UI for popup select screens. The style
                of the row changes when it is selected, and the button changes to
                "Deselect". If adding or editing, in the popup window, "Submit
                &amp; Select" button appears.
            </li>
            <li>
                Instead of the little asterisk for editing a column, clicking
                on the column header now shows a drop-down menu with display
                options. Essentially gives quick access to the options on the
                display options page (hiding columns and moving columns). There is
                a new column on the far left with a "+" that allows you to select
                new columns to display.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added a Clients checkbox to the Admin Users screen so that it
                is easier to see what clients a user is associated to.
            </li>
            <li>
                An admin link can now contain a variable. So the new href can
                be
                ex_checklist.cfm?action=View&amp;Searching=1&amp;ChecklistStatusID=1,2&amp;userid=#session.userid#
            </li>
            <li>
                For columns of type "select-multiple" box automatically expands
                up to 10 to hold items and make it easier to scroll when the list
                is long.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added "Search" and "Reset" buttons to the top of search page
                and aligned right to make consistent with Add/Edit page.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added event "OnAfterSearch" to include code at the bottom of
                the view page. Architecture Changes:
            </li>
            <li>
                Added MCFLib_cf5.cfm and MCFLib_mx.cfm files to split function
                library so that preferred mx methods can be implemented without
                dropping support for CF5.
            </li>
        </ul>
